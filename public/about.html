<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a Korean-Kiwi webpage developer with a long history in teaching English literature before I decided to try out
  working in hospitality. My passion was in teaching English literature and for 6 years I taught high school students
  how to convey their thoughts and analysis in essay writing. </p>

<p>After 6 years of teaching, I decided to try new things and pivoted to working in hospitality. I worked at a casino
  as a VIP gaming machines host at SkyCity; the experience was eye opening, learning about different sides of society
  and of people with vastly different values than I did. Having spent 6 years of my life prior to this teaching, it was
  a kick in the pants for me to remember the importance of always learning and broadening my horizons.

<p>As I worked at SkyCity, I decided to challenge myself to learn coding, which I had always been intimidated by.
  With the encouragement of friends and family who are working in software engineering, I gave it a shot and enrolled
  in a bootcamp to brush up on the fundamentals of website development. As I kept chugging away at the computer, 
  learning how to code, I found that it was the perfect outlet of creative puzzle-solving. I loved learning new things
  to add to my tool box of knowledge and found myself excited in challenging new problems that arose during projects.
  After doing this for some time and developing my own projects borne from my own interests in gaming, I decided to 
  focus on a career in web development!
