<h1>The Best Movies According to Nathan</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>The cinematography and CGI is amazing</p>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>The choreography and world building is just *chef's kiss*</p>
<p>The second film goes even harder with its action and world building</p>

<h3>Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>The way the movie bridges the prequels and the sequels while telling the story through a Shakespearean tragedy makes this a highlight of the franchise</p>
